This project is a hands-on exploration of modern web development and deployment practices, featuring:

* **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript
* **Backend**: ASP.NET Core (C#), Web API, Entity Framework
* **Databases**: SQL & NoSQL (Postgres, MongoDB)
* **DevOps**: Docker for containerization, with a focus on production-ready deployments

Forma is designed to help developers learn how to build and deploy scalable web applications using a modern tech stack.
